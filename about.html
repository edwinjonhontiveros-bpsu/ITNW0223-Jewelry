      <h2>A collective born from sparkling minds.</h2>
      <p>
        The trio, who were friends since college, have been working on their first jewelry
        business in the bustling city of Balanga, but it had ultimately failed because of
        their strategic location that is not known by the locals. Nevertheless, they still
        didn't give up on their dreams as they launch their second jewelry business across
        other places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the success of their second business -- <b>The BhemðŸ’Ž Jewels</b> -- they
        decided to headquarter their operations in the tranquil town of Limay. It served as
        a staple that no matter what hurdles they may face, they can make it through as
        long as they're together.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The "Bhem" in the Name
      </h2>
      <p>
        The name "Bhem" has derived from a nickname that originated from one of the
        co-leaders. His idea spurred from his first love, whom he nicknamed such for
        commemorative purposes. Although the relationship did not bear fruit in the long
        run, the nickname still remained as the catalyst to the operations -- most of which
        are recognizable everywhere in the country.
